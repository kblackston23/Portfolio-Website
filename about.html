        <p>
          I am a web developer with a background in graphic design and customer service. In my previous roles, I was often tasked with things that required a lot of analysis, problem solving, and effective communication, such as explaining itemized billing statements or preparing cost estimates for healthcare patients. </p>
          <p>Although I have a history of working in customer service, my true passion is creating. By studying studio art as an undergraduate, I was able to explore all types of creative fields outside of my graphic design emphasis such as web design, ceramics, and woodworking. These studies helped me develop creative problem solving and excellent time management skills, not to mention a high attention to detail and loads of patience.</p>
          <p></p>After working in customer service for a few years, I decided to turn my passion for creating into a profession in web development. Using my design skills and creative mind, I want to build beautiful, responsive websites and apps that are progressive and innovative.
